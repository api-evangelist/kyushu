> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Kyushu University (九州大学) is a national research university in Fukuoka, Japan, ranked #167 in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This repository catalogs the institution's public developer/API footprint as an [APIs.json](https://apisjson.org) provider profile. The verifiable public surface is concentrated in the Kyushu University Library, which exposes scholarly metadata from its institutional repository (QIR) over a live OAI-PMH 2.0 interface and via bulk TSV downloads. There is no central, institution-wide developer portal.

## Notes

- Verification discipline: only endpoints confirmed live are cataloged as APIs. The QIR OAI-PMH endpoint returned a valid OAI-PMH 2.0 Identify response (repositoryName "Kyushu University Institutional Repository (QIR)", JPCOAR schema, adminEmail qir@jimu.kyushu-u.ac.jp).
- A legacy DSpace OAI endpoint (`qir.kyushu-u.ac.jp/dspace-oai`) no longer resolves; QIR has migrated to the WEKO-based `catalog.lib.kyushu-u.ac.jp` platform.
- The Elsevier Pure research portal and the Academic Staff researcher database are public for browsing but document no open/public API.
- `RIIT-KyushuUniv` is an institute-level GitHub org (Research Institute for Information Technology), not a central university account; no official university-wide GitHub org was confirmed.
- The LinkedIn school page returns an anti-bot 999 status to automated fetches; the URL uses the standard school slug.
